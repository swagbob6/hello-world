# hello-world

just getting started on github :^)

My name is Levi and I've been tinkering with coding and development since I was in middle school. As an adult, I want to get back into coding for the sake of bettering myself, and for the sake of contributing my knowledge to the community. I was always afraid of making "bad code", but now, as an adult, I see that making contributions in the community is nothing to be ashamed of, even if what I think will work is wrong.

I hope that I can help out, even in the smallest way possible!
